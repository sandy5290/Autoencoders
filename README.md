# Autoencoders 
A autoencoder is a neural network that has three layers: an input layer, a hidden (encoding) layer, and a decoding layer. The network is trained to reconstruct its inputs, which forces the hidden layer to try to learn good representations of the inputs.

Whenever we build a MLP, random weights are assigned initially. In this code, rather than assigning random weights , we learn the weights using autoencoders and then use these learned weights in our mlp to build model.
